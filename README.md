Using an sqlite database in a golang web application 

## Purpose

This program has a solely educational purpose. It is intended for exploring the use of Go to build a web application based on an sqlite database. Therefoer, it is heavily influenced by tutorials available at go.dev.

## Next steps

Currently, the application can only be used to query the database by artist. No entries can be added. Next, I want to deploy the application. 

  - Clean up branches
  - Add file handler for the sqlite file
  - Deploy application
